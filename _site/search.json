This indicates that boys tend to have higher average scores in math and science.\nFor reading, the peak of the girls’ density curve is to the right of the boys’. This means that girls have better performance in reading compared with boys.\nHowever, the curves overlap significantly across all subjects.

These plots reveal a strong positive correlation between average scores across all subjects, indicating that Schools with high performance in one subject tend to perform well in others too.\n\nThis suggests that factors influencing School performance may be systemic rather than subject specific. Schools with higher performance on a specific subject also performs well on other subjects.\n\n3.4 Performance Comparison by Socioeconomic Status\nConstructing pairwise heatmap plots for home possessions, education level, and vocational training level, vesus the total average score.\n\n\nSchool Education v.s.

Similarly, given a level of home possessions, there is a positive correlation between education and total average score. This is in line with our expectations.\nSome blank areas on the heatmap represent missing data.\nStudents whose parents have a medium level of home possessions but higher education have the highest average scores.\n\nTotal average score is related to arbitrary two of the three indexes.\n\n\nSocieconomic Status\nSchool Education\nHome Possessions\nVocational Training\n\n\n\n\nClick to view the code.combined &lt;- combined %&gt;%\n  mutate(socioeconomic_group = ntile(socioeconomic_status, 5))\n\n# Plot the density of total_avg scores for each socioeconomic group in a column layout\nggplot(combined, aes(x = Total_Avg, fill = factor(socioeconomic_group))) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = \"white\", size = 0.5) + \n  labs(title = \"Density of Total Average Scores for Socioeconomic Groups\", \n       x = \"Total Average Score\", \n       y = \"Density\",\n       fill = \"Socioeconomic Group\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgray\", linetype = \"dashed\"),) +\n  facet_wrap(~socioeconomic_group, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view the code.combined &lt;- combined %&gt;%\n  mutate(school_education_group = ntile(sum_school_education, 5))\n\nggplot(combined, aes(x = Total_Avg, fill = factor(school_education_group))) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = \"white\", size = 0.5) + \n  labs(title = \"Density of Total Average Scores for School Education Groups\", \n       x = \"Total Average Score\", \n       y = \"Density\",\n       fill = \"School Education Group\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgray\", linetype = \"dashed\"),) +\n  facet_wrap(~school_education_group, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view the code.combined &lt;- combined %&gt;%\n  mutate(home_possessions_group = ntile(sum_home_possessions, 5))\n\nggplot(combined, aes(x = Total_Avg, fill = factor(home_possessions_group))) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = \"white\", size = 0.5) + \n  labs(title = \"Density of Total Average Scores for Home Possessions Groups\", \n       x = \"Total Average Score\", \n       y = \"Density\",\n       fill = \"Home Possessions Group\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgray\", linetype = \"dashed\"),) +\n  facet_wrap(~home_possessions_group, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view the code.combined &lt;- combined %&gt;%\n  mutate(vocational_training_group = ntile(sum_vocational_training, 5))\n\nggplot(combined, aes(x = Total_Avg, fill = factor(vocational_training_group))) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = \"white\", size = 0.5) + \n  labs(title = \"Density of Total Average Scores for Vocational Training Groups\", \n       x = \"Total Average Score\", \n       y = \"Density\",\n       fill = \"Vocational Training Group\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgray\", linetype = \"dashed\"),) +\n  facet_wrap(~vocational_training_group, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom level 1 to level 3, we see that as families have more money and resources, their children’s school scores usually get better. This improvement might be because these families can afford better learning materials, better schools, or more help with studies.\nHowever, once they reach a higher income level (level 3 to level 5), making even more money doesn’t seem to help the kids’ scores increase much further.\n\nThis suggests that after a certain point, just having more resources doesn’t continue to boost school performance in the same way."
