<p>Things to learn from the code chunk above.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>groupColumn</code> argument is used to group the observations (i.e.&nbsp;parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e.&nbsp;Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.</p></li>
<li><p><code>scale</code> argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using <code>uniminmax</code> method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.</p></li>
<li><p><code>alphaLines</code> argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.</p></li>
<li><p><code>boxplot</code> argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical <code>TRUE</code>. The default is <code>FALSE</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>title</code> argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="parallel-coordinates-with-facet" class="level3" data-number="2.3"><h3 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parallel-coordinates-with-facet">
<span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Parallel coordinates with facet</h3>
<p>Since <code>ggparcoord()</code> is developed by extending <strong><em>ggplot2</em></strong> package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.</p>
<p>In the code chunk below, <code>facet_wrap()</code> of <strong><em>ggplot2</em></strong> is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.</p>

<p>Thing to learn from the code chunk above:</p>
<ul>
<li>To rotate x-axis text labels, we use <code>axis.text.x</code> as argument to <code>theme()</code> function. And we specify <code>element_text(angle = 30)</code> to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.</li>

<span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Adjusting the rotated x-axis text label</h3>
<p>Rotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using <code>hjust</code> argument to theme’s text element with <code>element_text()</code>. We use <code>axis.text.x</code> as we want to change the look of x-axis text.</p>
